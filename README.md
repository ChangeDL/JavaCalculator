# JavaCalculator

This is a practice I'm doing in Java using the Scanner import to make a calculator

UPDATE (8/7/2023): Made a basic calculator that takes in two numbers that can be Added, Subtracted, Multiplied, or Divided. 

UPDATE (8/8/2023): Created Variable to contain the result of a calculation to allow for continuation without having to remember previous results. Also changed the operations from number inputs to their actual symbols
