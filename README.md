# JavaCalculator

This is a practice I'm doing in Java using the Scanner import to make a calculator

UPDATE (8/7/2023): Made a basic calculator that takes in two numbers that can be Added, Subtracted, Multiplied, or Divided. 

UPDATE (8/8/2023): Created Variable to contain the calculation result to allow for continuation without the user having to remember the previous result mentally. Also changed the operations from number inputs to their actual symbols

UPDATE (8/9/2023): Added an exponent and square root option.

UPDATE (8/9/2023): Adjusted code for square root to be asked first so the user will only have to input one number instead of having to do extra steps. Also added error handling so insure no errors or NaN when finding square roots.

UPDATE (8/13/2023): Put the order of inputs in the correct order [num1, operation, num2]. Also added the option to find the percentage of a number
